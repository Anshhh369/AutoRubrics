  16-20 Points: Good documentation with clear descriptions and evaluations, includes some comparative analysis and evidence, but lacks some depth in critical reflection.
  8-15 Points: Basic documentation, lacks depth in evaluations and comparative analysis, with minimal supporting evidence.
  0-7 Points: Inadequate documentation, minimal or no descriptions of processes, lacks critical evaluation.
  
  This expanded rubric should better guide the assessment of students' work, emphasizing critical evaluation and original thought in their academic exploration.
  
  
  
  
  Example 2:
  Here is a structured rubric for an AI-powered application project. It will focus on the thorough understanding and holistic effort of students, with special attention to the data collection process and the diversity of bot functionalities. Additionally, creativity in solution design and utility, along with comprehensive evaluation, will be key aspects.
  
  Point Allocation:
  Data Collection and Bot Functionality: 40 points
  Creativity and Solution Utility: 30 points
  Evaluation and Testing Process: 20 points
  Professionalism: 10 points
  
  Detailed Rubric:
  1. Data Collection and Bot Functionality (40 Points)
  35-40 Points: Exceptional variety in data collection sources and methods; the bot can perform complex and varied actions on the data that demonstrate deep integration and understanding.
  25-34 Points: Good variety and integration, but actions are somewhat basic or expected.
  0-24 Points: Limited data sources, minimal variety in bot actions, or poor integration of data with bot functionalities.
